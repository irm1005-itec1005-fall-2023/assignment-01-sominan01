          <h6>Band, the Angry Inch</h6>
          <p>Angry Inch Band and ItsHak appear on stage and the play begins with musical instrument setting. After all the setting, itzhak introduces Hedwig, who appears in the audience. (Tear me down) Hedwig, who opened the show by renting the set of the Fast and Furious musical, which was ruined as soon as it opened, talks about the car accident with Tommy Nossis, saying that he appeared in the newspaper recently. Then, "very accidentally," Tommy Nossis is said to be performing around the theater, and he overhears it through the back door under the guise of a vending machine, and Hedwig, who was expecting to tell him about himself when the article had already been published, gets annoyed and closes the back door of the concert hall when Tommy doesn't tell him about himself.</p>
